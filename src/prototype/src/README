If you can read this file, then you probably have successfully created
you project, {{ project.name }}. Normally, this project should run smoothly on
your web server. If it doesn't:

    1. Check that the address in your browser is correct (you must hit the
       www/ directory).
    2. Check that the .htaccess file located in the src/ directory is correct
    3. Get in touch: a.dotreppe@aspyct.org or @aspyct on twitter

This freshly created project already has Silex and Twig installed. In addition
to that, the latest version of Composer has been installed as well. It also
comes with a basic phing configuration file.



The src/ directory contains all the PHP files of the project. These are the ones
that you will deploy to the server later.

The tests/ directory contains the PHPUnit testcases. You can run them via phing
`phing phpunit`, provided that phing and phpunit are properly installed on your
system.
